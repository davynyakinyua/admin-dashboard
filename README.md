# admin-dashboard
Admin dashboard is a beautiful project that is made using HTML5 and css3

# Details
This project showcases the use of CSS grid to arrange containers and items
on a very specific point on the viewport. The use of CSS grid to arrange this 
containers and items on two dimensions, rows and columns comes in very handy.

There is also some use of CSS flexbox to arrange items on one dimension either row or column.

# Summary
This project was very engageful and exciting.
I got to practice a lot of the things we have learnt since the 
we began on this journey of Web Development. This brings us to the end of 
intermediate HTML and CSS and look forward to continueing with JavaScript.

# Feedback will be greatly appreciated
